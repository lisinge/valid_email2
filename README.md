Validate emails with the help of the `mail` gem instead of some cluncy regexp.  
Aditionally validate that the domain has a MX record.  
Optionally validate against a static [list of disposable email services](vendor/disposable_emails.yml).


### Why?

There are lots of other gems and libraries that validates email adresses but most of them use some cluncy regexp.  
I also saw a need to be able to validate that the email address is not coming from a "disposable email" provider.

### Is it production ready?

Yes, it is used in several production apps.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "valid_email2"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install valid_email2

## Usage

### Use with ActiveModel

If you just want to validate that it is a valid email address:
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :email, presence: true, email: true
end
```

To validate that the domain has a MX record:  
```ruby
validates :email, email: { mx: true }
```

To validate that the domain is not a disposable email:  
```ruby
validates :email, email: { disposable: true }
```

All together:  
```ruby
validates :email, email: { mx: true, disposable: true }
```

> Note that this gem will let an empty email pass through so you will need to
> add `presence: true` if you require an email

### Use without ActiveModel

```ruby
address = ValidEmail2::Address.new("lisinge@gmail.com")
address.valid? => true
address.disposable? => false
address.valid_mx? => true
```
